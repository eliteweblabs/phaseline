| Configuration Files        | Description                                                              |

## Theme Customization

### Customize the Colors

The theme uses two main colors: primary and neutral. These colors are defined in the Tailwind CSS configuration file. To personalize the color scheme of your project, you can easily modify these color values.

To customize the colors, follow these steps:

1. Open the `global.css` file.
2. Find the `theme` section within the file.
3. Under `theme`, locate the `Colors`.
4. Modify the color values for `primary` and `neutral` to suit your preferred color palette.

You can use the [tailwind CSS colors](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or create your [own palette](https://uicolors.app/create) .

### Customize the Fonts

To customize the fonts used in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Add Your Custom Font Files**
   Replace or add the desired font files in the public directory of your project.

2. **Update the Tailwind CSS Configuration**

   Open the `global.css` file. In the `@font-face` section, find the `font-family` property and update the `font-family` object.

### Dark/Light Mode

By default, the site uses forced modes, which can be either light or dark, depending on the chosen layout. The light layout sets the class to **`mode-light`** and the dark layout sets it to **`mode-dark`**. This setting allows you to maintain a fixed appearance across the site regardless of user preferences or system settings.

However, if you want to give users the ability to switch between themes, you can configure the theme to use the **`mode-auto`** class. You can easily do this by adding the **`mode-auto`** class to the **`src/layouts/Layout.astro`** file instead of using **`mode-light`** or **`mode-dark`** and uncommenting the ThemeSwitcher component in the NavigationBar component.

## Content Management

Solid Builders includes Keystatic CMS integration for Case Studies collection management. The configuration can be found in `keystatic.config.ts`, which defines:

- Content collections structure
- Field configurations
- Storage settings

To use Keystatic:

1. Run the development server
2. Access the dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:4321/keystatic`
3. Configure cloud storage in production:

```typescript
storage: import.meta.env.DEV === true ? { kind: "local" } : { kind: "cloud" },
cloud: {
  project: '[TEAM_NAME]/[PROJECT_NAME]',
},
```

4. Set the folder for the content files in the `collections` property

For more details, see [Keystatic's documentation](https://keystatic.com/docs/introduction).
